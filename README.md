# PythonProjects

A repository of some projects I worked on during my free time while pursuing my Master's degree.

1. Converting an Image to a Pencil Sketch: Converting an image to its pencil sketch version using OpenCV. The project was inspired by a prompt from StrataScratch. The code uses OpenCV's edge detection and image blurring functions to create a pencil sketch effect. The repository includes a sample image which was supplied by StrataScratch.
